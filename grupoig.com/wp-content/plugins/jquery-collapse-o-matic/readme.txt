Remove clutter, save space: display and hide additional content in a SEO friendly way by wrapping content in an [expand] shortcode.

== Description ==

Collapse-O-Matic adds an `[expand title="trigger text"]hidden content[/expand]` shortcode that will wrap any content, including other shortcodes, into a lovely jQuery expanding and collapsing div.  A <a href='http://plugins.twinpictures.de/plugins/collapse-o-matic/documentation/'>complete listing of shortcode options and attribute demos</a> are available, as well as <a href='http://wordpress.org/tags/jquery-collapse-o-matic'>free community</a> and <a href='http://plugins.twinpictures.de/plugins/collapse-o-matic/support/'>premium support</a>. This plug-in was originally inspired by DrLebowski's Collapsing Objects.
